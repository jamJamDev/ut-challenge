# Undercover Tourist Challenge
A challenge I completed for Undercover Tourist using vanilla HTML, CSS, & JavaScript!
Recreated a static webpage from an image with a few functional requirements. 

<div align="center">
  <img width="300px" alt="frogprincess" title="frog princess" src="https://img.clipartxtras.com/0d1551050696fa78a25daa9553c61f14_cartoon-frog-wearing-a-crown-clip-art-vector-images-frog-with-crown-clipart_612-581.jpeg" >
</div>
